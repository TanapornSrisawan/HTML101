        <p>"The little village on the edge of the rainforest,” as Vancouver was once famously described, is no longer
            that. Sure, the city’s incredible natural beauty remains undimmed—surrounded by snow-capped mountains on one
            side and the Pacific on the other, Canada’s third largest city is a rare place where “ you can swim in the
            ocean in the morning and go skiing in the afternoon,” according to cliché. (Nobody does this. Still.) Today,
            this sophisticated, cosmopolitan center is not just for the sporty, Gore-tex clad crowd. Perennially near or
            at the top of most “Best Places to Live” lists, travelers are drawn to this bustling seaport for its parks,
            museums, shopping and, perhaps most notably, a rich and varied culinary and cocktail scene that has become
            even more impressive after the city’s star turn hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics. Oh, and about that rain?
            In the summer, Vancouver is the driest major city in Canada. Just sayin’.</p>
